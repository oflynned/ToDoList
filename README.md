# ToDoList
Android Mobile Application

This is a simple To-Do Checklist Android Application that allows the user to:
      - save tasks (with due dates and descriptions) 
      - save notes/memos; These can be then sent to the user's default email app, where the subject and body of the email is autmatically populated
      
A database is implemented to save the app state on destruction so that the app data can be restored once the app is started again.
